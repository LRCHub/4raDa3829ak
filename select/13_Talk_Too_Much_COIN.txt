Caffeine, small talk
Wait out the plastic weather
Mm-hmm, uh-uh
Discussing current events
I'll take my time
I'm not the forward thinker
You read my mind
Better to leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid

You know I talk too much!
Honey come put your lips on mine and
Shut me up
We can blame it all on human nature
Stay cool it's just a kiss
So why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much
We talk too much

You know my type
Tightrope across the table
Mm-hmm, uh-uh
I can't keep holding my breath
New wave
No time
Red velvet
Under pressure
Blah blah
Green eyes
I never leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid

You know I talk too much
Honey come put your lips on mine and
Shut me up
We can blame it all on human nature
Stay cool it's just a kiss
So why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much
We talk too much

Silence is golden
And you've got my hopes up
We talk too much
No hesitation
What are we waiting for?
We talk too much

You know I talk too much
Honey come put your lips on mine and
Shut me up
We can blame it all on human nature
Stay cool it's just a kiss
So why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much
We talk too much
