Talk too much, I talk too much
I never stop, I never hush
I just keep talking, I never pause
I talk so much, I fill the house

I tell my stories, I give my thoughts
I never listen, I never stop
I just keep talking, I never hear
The things that others have to share

But I don't mean to be this way
It's just my nature, I can't help but say
The words that come into my mind
Even if they don't make sense sometimes

So if I talk too much, don't mind
Just let me ramble, let me unwind
I'll quiet down eventually
But for now, just let me be

Talk too much, I talk too much
But I'm just trying to stay in touch
With the world around me, with the ones I love
So please forgive me if I talk too much
