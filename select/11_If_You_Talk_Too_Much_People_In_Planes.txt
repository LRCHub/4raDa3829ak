I don't want you to try and save me,
No I don't want you at all,
If we're through, then you don't blame me,
'Cause that won't do at all

If you talk too much my head will explode (x7)

You've no time to reconcile me,
There's no time left at all,
And I'll take my share, and then I'll vanish,
I want my share, that's all.

If you talk too much my head will explode (x7)

Can't complain, I feel sly (?)
You can get up and go

I don't want you to try and save me,
No I don't want you at all

If you talk too much my head will explode (repeat to end)
(Backing part: If you talk too much my head will blow)
