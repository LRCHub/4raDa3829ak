You talk too much
You talk too much, baby
You talk too much
You yak, yak, yak

You talk in the mornin'
You talk all night long
You talk about people that don't
That even don't know you

You talk too much, mama
You yak, yak, yak

You yak your mouth
Your big mouth will ruin you, woman
Your big mouth will ruin you, woman
Yak, yak, yak all the time
Talk about people that
You just don't know
Yak, yak, yak
Yak, yak, yak all the time
Yak, yak, yak your big mouth
All the time, all the time
You talk too much woman
