```lrc
[00:21.12] Caffeine, small talk
[00:23.54] Wait out the plastic weather
[00:25.86] Mm-hmm, uh-uh
[00:28.07] Discussing current events
[00:30.59] I'll take my time
[00:32.78] I'm not the forward thinker
[00:35.02] You read my mind
[00:37.32] Better to leave it unsaid
[00:42.08] Why can't I leave it unsaid
[00:55.58] 
[00:46.78] You know I talk too much!
[00:50.70] Honey come put your lips on mine and
[00:53.20] Shut me up
[00:55.46] We can blame it all on human nature
[00:58.03] Stay cool it's just a kiss
[00:59.96] So why you gotta be so talkative?
[01:02.32] I talk too much
[01:04.45] We talk too much
[01:12.45] 
[01:16.65] You know my type
[01:18.98] Tightrope across the table
[01:21.27] Mm-hmm, uh-uh
[01:23.46] I can't keep holding my breath
[01:25.87] New wave
[01:27.06] No time
[01:28.22] Red velvet
[01:29.01] Under pressure
[01:30.55] Blah blah
[01:31.54] Green eyes
[01:32.88] I never leave it unsaid
[01:37.35] Why can't I leave it unsaid
[01:50.85] 
[01:42.19] You know I talk too much
[01:46.12] Honey come put your lips on mine and
[01:48.68] Shut me up
[01:50.73] We can blame it all on human nature
[01:53.48] Stay cool it's just a kiss
[01:55.35] So why you gotta be so talkative?
[01:57.53] I talk too much
[01:59.87] We talk too much
[02:07.87] 
[02:07.07] Silence is golden
[02:09.46] And you've got my hopes up
[02:12.47] We talk too much
[02:16.36] No hesitation
[02:18.65] What are we waiting for?
[02:22.86] We talk too much
[02:30.86] 
[02:44.62] You know I talk too much
[02:48.59] Honey come put your lips on mine and
[02:50.83] Shut me up
[02:53.15] We can blame it all on human nature
[02:55.74] Stay cool it's just a kiss
[02:57.58] So why you gotta be so talkative?
[02:59.93] I talk too much
[03:02.12] We talk too much
